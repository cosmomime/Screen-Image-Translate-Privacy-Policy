# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** October 2025

Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is available as a freemium app with optional premium subscriptions. This SERVICE is provided with both free and premium tiers and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the Cosmo Screen & Image Translate app unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Overview

Cosmo Screen & Image Translate primarily processes image data for translation purposes. The app captures screenshots and processes images that you explicitly select. You can choose between local offline translation (using ML Kit) or online translation services (DeepSeek, OpenRouter) that require internet connectivity.

> **Core Privacy Principles:**
> - **Local translation:** All processing occurs on your device - images and translations never leave your device
> - **Online translation:** Text content is sent to third-party APIs only when you explicitly choose online services
> - We integrate with third-party services for ads (free users), crash reporting, and billing
> - Premium users have no advertising data collection

## Information We Collect

### Local Data (Stored on Your Device)
- App preferences and settings
- User tier status (free/premium)
- Translation glossary entries
- Cached translation models

### Third-Party Data Collection
- **Google AdMob** (free users): Device identifiers, usage patterns, advertising data, general location
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Crash reports, performance data, device information
- **Google Play Services**: Device info, account authentication, billing data
- **Google Play Billing**: Purchase transactions, subscription status
- **DeepSeek API** (when using online translation): Text content for translation, API usage metadata
- **OpenRouter API** (when using online translation): Text content for translation, API usage metadata

**Note:** Local translation processing occurs entirely on your device - your images and translations never leave your device. Online translation services only transmit text content when you explicitly choose these options.

## Advertising and Monetization

### Free User Advertising

Free users will see advertisements provided by Google AdMob. These ads help support the development and maintenance of the app.

**Types of Ads:**
- Banner ads displayed within the app interface
- Native ads integrated within the app's content areas
- Interstitial ads shown at natural break points (10-minute minimum intervals)
- Rewarded video ads that provide temporary access to premium features

**Data Collection by AdMob:**

Google AdMob may collect and use the following information to provide personalized advertisements:
- Device information (device model, operating system, unique device identifiers)
- App usage information (interactions with ads, app usage patterns)
- Advertising ID for personalized ads
- Network connectivity information
- Location information (general location, not precise real-time location data)

**Ad Personalization:**

You can control ad personalization through your device's advertising settings:
- **Android:** Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization
- You can also reset your advertising ID in the same settings menu

**Premium Users:** Premium subscribers do not see advertisements and are not subject to advertising data collection.

### In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

We offer premium subscriptions and in-app purchases processed through Google Play Billing:

**Purchase Information Collected:**
- Purchase transaction details (product purchased, price, date)
- Google Play account information (as provided by Google Play)
- Purchase verification tokens for security

**Payment Processing:** All payment processing is handled securely by Google Play. We do not directly collect or store your payment card information.
**Subscription Management:** Subscription status and renewal information is managed through Google Play and synchronized with our app to provide premium features.

## Error Reporting and Crash Analytics

### Firebase Crashlytics

We use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect crash reports and app performance data to help us improve the app's stability and performance.

**Information Collected:**
- Crash logs and stack traces
- Device information (model, operating system version, available memory)
- App version and configuration at the time of the crash
- User actions leading up to the crash (anonymized)
- Performance metrics (app startup time, network request performance)

**Data Usage:** This information is used solely to identify and fix bugs, improve app performance, and enhance user experience. Crash data is anonymized and does not contain personal information.

### Local Error Logs

The app may also generate error logs stored locally on your device. These logs are not automatically transmitted and remain under your control. If you contact us for technical support, we may ask you to voluntarily share relevant logs to help diagnose issues.

## Data Storage and Local Processing

### Cookies and Tracking Technologies

The app itself does not use cookies directly. However, third-party services integrated within the app may use local storage or similar technologies:
- **AdMob:** May store advertising preferences and identifiers locally
- **Firebase:** May store analytics and crash reporting identifiers
- **Google Play Services:** May store authentication and billing information

This data is stored locally on your device and managed by the respective third-party services according to their privacy policies.

## Translation Processing

### Local Translation (ML Kit)

All image processing and translation occurs locally on your device using Google's ML Kit. No images, text, or translations are transmitted to external servers. Translation models are downloaded and stored locally on your device.

### Online Translation Services (Optional)

You may optionally choose online translation services (DeepSeek or OpenRouter) that require internet connectivity. When using these services:
- Only the extracted text content is sent to the chosen API provider
- Images never leave your device
- You must provide your own API keys for these services
- Data is transmitted securely over HTTPS
- Translation results are processed locally after being received

**Important:** Online translation services are clearly marked in the app and require explicit user selection. You can switch between local and online services at any time.

## API Key Management

For online translation services, you must provide your own API keys for DeepSeek and OpenRouter services. These keys are:
- **Stored locally** on your device only
- **Not transmitted** to our servers or any third parties except the chosen translation service
- **Used only** for making authenticated requests to the translation APIs
- **Encrypted** using Android's built-in security features

**Security Note:** API keys are sensitive credentials. We recommend using dedicated API keys with limited permissions and monitoring your usage through the respective service providers. You are responsible for securing your API keys and managing your account usage with these third-party services.

## Security

We prioritize your data security through local processing and secure third-party infrastructure. Your images and translations never leave your device. Payment processing uses Google's secure infrastructure. While we implement best practices for secure local processing and data transmission, please note that no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on your device or transmitted to third-party services.

## Screen Capture and File Access Permissions

Our app requires screen capture permissions to take screenshots for translation and file access permissions through the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to save translated images. The Storage Access Framework allows our app to access only the specific files or directories that you explicitly select, rather than requiring broad access to all files on your device. These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the app and not for collecting personal data.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our app, you can disable personalized ads through Android device settings, clear app data to remove any locally stored preferences, or consider using premium features to eliminate advertising entirely.

## Data Management

### Local Data

Data stored locally on your device (preferences, glossaries, cached models) is retained until you clear the app's data through Android settings, uninstall the application, or manually delete specific data like glossary entries.

### Third-Party Data

Advertising data is retained according to Google's policies, crash reports are typically retained for 90 days, and purchase data is retained according to Google Play's billing policies and legal requirements.

### Data Deletion

To delete your data, clear app data in Android settings or uninstall the app (local), reset your advertising ID in Android settings (ads), or contact us to request deletion of specific crash reports.

## User Responsibility for Translated Content

Users are solely responsible for ensuring they have proper rights and permissions before distributing or sharing translated images, particularly for copyrighted material such as comics, manga, or other protected content. This app is a translation tool only - users must comply with all applicable copyright laws and intellectual property rights. We are not responsible for any copyright infringement or legal issues arising from user-generated translations or distribution of translated content.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
