    <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the Cosmo Screen & Image Translate app unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate primarily processes image data for translation purposes. The app captures screenshots and processes images that you explicitly select.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Core Privacy Principles:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>All translation processing occurs locally on your device</li>
            <li>Your images and translations never leave your device</li>

    <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Local Data Processing</h3>
    <p>The core translation functionality processes all image data entirely on your device and is not transmitted to external servers. The app does not require personal information such as your name, email address, or location for translation features. Any images or translations you create are stored only on your device in locations you specify through the Storage Access Framework.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> While translation processing is local, the app does integrate with third-party services (detailed below) that may collect certain data for advertising, crash reporting, and billing purposes.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust and prioritize the security of your data.</p>

    <h3>Local Data Security</h3>
    <p>For the core functionality of Cosmo Screen & Image Translate, all translation data is processed locally on your device without transmitting it to external servers. This local processing means your images and translations remain within the security boundaries of your own device. We use the Android Storage Access Framework which provides a secure method for accessing only the specific files you explicitly grant permission to access.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Data Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> All payment processing uses Google's secure infrastructure with industry-standard encryption and fraud protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Crash data is transmitted using secure HTTPS connections and stored on Google's secure servers.</li>
        <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> Advertising data is handled according to Google's security standards and privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While we implement best practices for secure local processing and data transmission, please note that no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on your device or transmitted to third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Screen Capture and File Access Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our app requires screen capture permissions to take screenshots for translation and file access permissions through the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to save translated images. The Storage Access Framework allows our app to access only the specific files or directories that you explicitly select, rather than requiring broad access to all files on your device. These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the app and not for collecting personal data.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we state that our app is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly market to this age group.</p>

    <h3>Data Collection and Children</h3>
    <p>While our core translation functionality processes all data locally on the device, we do integrate third-party services that may collect data:</p>

    <p><strong>For children under 13:</strong></p>

        <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13</li>
        <li>AdMob advertising is subject to Google's policies regarding children's data</li>
        <li>Firebase Crashlytics may collect technical data but does not collect personally identifiable information</li>
        <li>If we discover we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete it immediately</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Parental Controls:</strong></p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our app:</p>
