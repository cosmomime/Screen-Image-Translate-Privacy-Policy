    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is built as a paid app. This SERVICE is provided by at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    <p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
    <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the Cosmo Screen & Image Translate app unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate primarily processes image data for translation purposes. The app captures screenshots and processes images that you explicitly select.</p>

    <h3>Local Processing</h3>
    <p>In the current version, all data is processed entirely on your device and is not transmitted to external servers or collected by us in any way. The app does not require personal information such as your name, email address, or location. Any images or translations you create are stored only on your device in locations you specify through the Storage Access Framework.</p>

    <h3>Future Online Features</h3>
    <p>If you choose to use optional online translation features (if implemented in future updates), the app will transmit the text extracted from your images to third-party translation services. We will only transmit the text necessary for translation, not the entire images. Use of these features will be optional, clearly marked, and disabled by default.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The app uses Google Play Services, which may collect certain device information as outlined in their privacy policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we implement online translation features in the future, we will update this section with links to the privacy policies of those translation services.</p>

    <h2>Error Reporting and Logs</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate may generate error logs on your device when the app encounters problems. These logs are stored locally on your device and are not automatically transmitted to us.</p>
    <p>If the app crashes, Android's standard crash reporting system may prompt you to send a report to Google (not to us directly). These reports may include technical information such as your device model, operating system version, app configuration at the time of the error, and details about what the app was doing when the problem occurred. Sharing these reports is entirely voluntary and under your control.</p>
    <p>We do not collect or store these logs on our servers. If you contact us for technical support and we need to understand an error you're experiencing, we may ask you to voluntarily share relevant logs or screenshots.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is primarily an offline application and does not use cookies directly. However, some third-party components integrated within the app may use local storage or similar technologies to store small amounts of data on your device to improve functionality. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>Current Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Our app currently uses a limited number of third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play Services: Used for app distribution and updates through the Google Play Store</li>
        <li>OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library that runs entirely on your device for image processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Play Services may collect certain device information as outlined in their privacy policy. OpenCV operates entirely on your device and does not collect or transmit any personal information.</p>
    <p>In the current version, since Cosmo Screen & Image Translate processes data locally on your device, we do not share your images, translations, or other content with third parties. Any information collected by Google Play Services is subject to Google's privacy policy linked above.</p>

    <h3>Potential Future Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>In future updates, we may integrate additional third-party services such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Online translation services (like DeepL or similar): If implemented, these would process text extracted from your images to provide enhanced translation quality</li>
        <li>License Verification Library (LVL): For verifying legitimate purchases of our paid app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we implement these services, they will be clearly disclosed in updates to this privacy policy, including details about what data is shared with these services and links to their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust and prioritize the security of your data.</p>
    <p>For the core functionality of Cosmo Screen & Image Translate, all data is processed locally on your device without transmitting it to external servers. This local processing means your data remains within the security boundaries of your own device. We use the Android Storage Access Framework which provides a secure method for accessing only the specific files you explicitly grant permission to access.</p>
    <p>If you choose to use optional online translation features (if implemented in future updates), text data will be transmitted to third-party translation services using secure connections. However, we will never transmit your full images to external servers, only the extracted text for translation.</p>
    <p>While we implement best practices for secure local processing and data transmission, please note that no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on your device or transmitted to third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Translation Processing</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is designed to work primarily offline. The current translation models and processing are performed locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>Offline Translation</h3>
    <p>For offline translation features, we do not transmit your images or translations to any external servers. All processing occurs on your device to ensure your privacy.</p>

    <h3>Optional Online Translation Services</h3>
    <p>In future updates, we may offer optional online translation services (such as DeepL or similar services) to provide enhanced translation quality. If implemented, these features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will be clearly marked as using online services</li>
        <li>Will be optional and disabled by default</li>
        <li>Will require your explicit consent before activation</li>
        <li>Will transmit only the text to be translated (not the entire image) to the respective translation service</li>
        <li>Will be subject to the privacy policies of those third-party translation services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we implement online translation features, we will update this privacy policy with specific details about what data is transmitted, how it's used, and links to the relevant third-party privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Screen Capture and File Access Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our app requires screen capture permissions to take screenshots for translation and file access permissions through the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to save translated images. The Storage Access Framework allows our app to access only the specific files or directories that you explicitly select, rather than requiring broad access to all files on your device. These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the app and not for collecting personal data.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. The app does not collect personally identifiable information, as all data processing occurs locally on the device. However, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we state that our app is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly market to this age group.</p>
    <p>Since our app processes all data locally and doesn't transmit information to external servers, there is no collection of children's personal data by us. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our app and have concerns about privacy, please contact us and we will provide guidance on how to manage app permissions and data on your child's device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
