Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is available as a freemium app with optional premium subscriptions. This SERVICE is provided with both free and premium tiers and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the Cosmo Screen & Image Translate app unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Overview

Cosmo Screen & Image Translate primarily processes image data for translation purposes. The app captures screenshots and processes images that you explicitly select.

**Core Privacy Principles**:
- All translation processing occurs locally on your device
- Your images and translations never leave your device
- We integrate with third-party services for ads (free users), crash reporting, and billing
- Premium users have no advertising data collection

## What Information We Collect

### Local Data Processing
The core translation functionality processes all image data entirely on your device and is not transmitted to external servers. The app does not require personal information such as your name, email address, or location for translation features. Any images or translations you create are stored only on your device in locations you specify through the Storage Access Framework.

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device
- App preferences and settings
- User tier status (free/premium)
- Temporary access permissions for premium features

- **Google Play Services**: Device information, account authentication, billing data

**Ad Personalization**:
You can control ad personalization through your device's advertising settings:

## Error Reporting and Crash Analytics

**Data Usage**: This information is used solely to identify and fix bugs, improve app performance, and enhance user experience. Crash data is anonymized and does not contain personal information.

## Security

We value your trust and prioritize the security of your data.

### Local Data Security
For the core functionality of Cosmo Screen & Image Translate, all translation data is processed locally on your device without transmitting it to external servers. This local processing means your images and translations remain within the security boundaries of your own device. We use the Android Storage Access Framework which provides a secure method for accessing only the specific files you explicitly grant permission to access.

### Third-Party Data Security
**Google Play Billing**: All payment processing uses Google's secure infrastructure with industry-standard encryption and fraud protection.

**Firebase Crashlytics**: Crash data is transmitted using secure HTTPS connections and stored on Google's secure servers.

**AdMob**: Advertising data is handled according to Google's security standards and privacy policies.

While we implement best practices for secure local processing and data transmission, please note that no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on your device or transmitted to third-party services.

## Screen Capture and File Access Permissions

Our app requires screen capture permissions to take screenshots for translation and file access permissions through the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to save translated images. The Storage Access Framework allows our app to access only the specific files or directories that you explicitly select, rather than requiring broad access to all files on your device. These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the app and not for collecting personal data.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we state that our app is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly market to this age group.

### Data Collection and Children

**For children under 13**:
- We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13
- AdMob advertising is subject to Google's policies regarding children's data
- Firebase Crashlytics may collect technical data but does not collect personally identifiable information
