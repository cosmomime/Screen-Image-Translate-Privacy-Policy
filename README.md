## Security

We prioritize your data security through local processing and secure third-party infrastructure. Your images and translations never leave your device. Payment processing uses Google's secure infrastructure. While we implement best practices for secure local processing and data transmission, please note that no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on your device or transmitted to third-party services.

## Screen Capture and File Access Permissions

Our app requires screen capture permissions to take screenshots for translation and file access permissions through the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to save translated images. The Storage Access Framework allows our app to access only the specific files or directories that you explicitly select, rather than requiring broad access to all files on your device. These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the app and not for collecting personal data.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

Cosmo Screen & Image Translate is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our app, you can disable personalized ads through Android device settings, clear app data to remove any locally stored preferences, or consider using premium features to eliminate advertising entirely.

## Data Management

**Local Data**: Data stored locally on your device (preferences, glossaries, cached models) is retained until you clear the app's data through Android settings, uninstall the application, or manually delete specific data like glossary entries.

**Third-Party Data**: Advertising data is retained according to Google's policies, crash reports are typically retained for 90 days, and purchase data is retained according to Google Play's billing policies and legal requirements.

**Data Deletion**: To delete your data, clear app data in Android settings or uninstall the app (local), reset your advertising ID in Android settings (ads), or contact us to request deletion of specific crash reports.

## User Responsibility for Translated Content

Users are solely responsible for ensuring they have proper rights and permissions before distributing or sharing translated images, particularly for copyrighted material such as comics, manga, or other protected content. This app is a translation tool only - users must comply with all applicable copyright laws and intellectual property rights. We are not responsible for any copyright infringement or legal issues arising from user-generated translations or distribution of translated content.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
