<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="date"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 2025</div>

<p>Cosmo Screen &amp; Comic Translate is available as a freemium app with optional premium subscriptions. This SERVICE is provided with both free and premium tiers and is intended for use as is.</p>
<p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the Cosmo Screen &amp; Comic Translate app unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cosmo Screen &amp; Comic Translate primarily processes image data for translation purposes. The app captures screenshots and processes images that you explicitly select. You can choose between local offline translation (using ML Kit) or online translation services (DeepSeek, OpenRouter) that require internet connectivity.</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <strong>Core Privacy Principles:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local translation:</strong> All processing occurs on your device - images and translations never leave your device</li>
        <li><strong>Online translation:</strong> Text content is sent to third-party APIs only when you explicitly choose online services</li>
        <li><strong>Clipboard Access:</strong> The app accesses your device clipboard only when you explicitly use the Copy or Paste features within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Local PDF Export:</strong> PDF creation and generation happens locally on your device</li>
        <li>We integrate with third-party services for ads (free users), crash reporting, and billing</li>
        <li>Premium users have no advertising data collection</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Local Data (Stored on Your Device)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    <li>User tier status (free/premium)</li>
    <li>Translation glossary entries</li>
    <li>Cached translation models</li>
    <li><strong>Clipboard Data:</strong> Temporary access to text content when using Copy/Paste features in the Advanced Viewer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Third-Party Data Collection</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (free users): Device identifiers, usage patterns, advertising data, general location</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Anonymized usage statistics and feature engagement to improve app functionality</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>: Crash reports, performance data, device information</li>

    <li><strong>DeepSeek API</strong> (when using online translation): Text content for translation, API usage metadata</li>
    <li><strong>OpenRouter API</strong> (when using online translation): Text content for translation, API usage metadata</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Local translation processing occurs entirely on your device - your images and translations never leave your device. Online translation services only transmit text content when you explicitly choose these options.</p>

<h2>Advertising and Monetization</h2>

    <li>Advertising ID for personalized ads</li>
    <li>Network connectivity information</li>
    <li>Location information (general location, not precise real-time location data)</li>

    <li>You can also reset your advertising ID in the same settings menu</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Premium Users:</strong> Premium subscribers do not see advertisements and are not subject to advertising data collection.</p>

<h2>Error Reporting and Crash Analytics</h2>

<h3>Firebase Crashlytics &amp; Analytics</h3>
<p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect crash reports and app performance data to help us improve the app's stability and performance. Additionally, we use Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with our features (e.g., frequency of Quick Translate usage) in an anonymized manner.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collected:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Crash logs and stack traces</li>
    <li>Device information (model, operating system version, available memory)</li>
    <li>App version and configuration at the time of the crash</li>
    <li>User actions leading up to the crash (anonymized)</li>
    <li>Performance metrics and feature usage statistics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data Usage:</strong> This information is used solely to identify and fix bugs, improve app performance, and enhance user experience. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized.</p>

<h3>Local Error Logs</h3>
<p>The app may also generate error logs stored locally on your device. These logs are not automatically transmitted and remain under your control. If you contact us for technical support, we may ask you to voluntarily share relevant logs to help diagnose issues.</p>

<h2>Data Storage and Local Processing</h2>


<h3>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>The app itself does not use cookies directly. However, third-party services integrated within the app may use local storage or similar technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> May store advertising preferences and identifiers locally</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> May store analytics and crash reporting identifiers</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> May store authentication and billing information</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is stored locally on your device and managed by the respective third-party services according to their privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Translation Processing</h2>

<h3>Local Translation (ML Kit)</h3>
<p>All image processing and translation occurs locally on your device using Google's ML Kit. No images, text, or translations are transmitted to external servers. Translation models are downloaded and stored locally on your device.</p>

<h3>Online Translation Services (Optional)</h3>
<p>You may optionally choose online translation services (DeepSeek or OpenRouter) that require internet connectivity. When using these services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only the extracted text content is sent to the chosen API provider</li>
    <li>Images never leave your device</li>
    <li>You must provide your own API keys for these services</li>
    <li>Data is transmitted securely over HTTPS</li>
    <li>Translation results are processed locally after being received</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Online translation services are clearly marked in the app and require explicit user selection. You can switch between local and online services at any time.</p>

<h3>Clipboard and PDF Operations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clipboard:</strong> The app requires clipboard access to facilitate the "Copy all" and "Paste all" functionality in the Advanced Viewer. This allows you to easily move text between our app and other translation tools. We do not store or transmit your clipboard history.</li>
    <li><strong>PDF Export:</strong> When you use the PDF export feature, all file generation is performed locally on your device using the iText library. The resulting PDF is saved to your chosen storage location and is not uploaded to any server.</li>
</ul>

<h2>API Key Management</h2>
<p>For online translation services, you must provide your own API keys for DeepSeek and OpenRouter services. These keys are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stored locally</strong> on your device only</li>
    <li><strong>Not transmitted</strong> to our servers or any third parties except the chosen translation service</li>
    <li><strong>Used only</strong> for making authenticated requests to the translation APIs</li>
    <li><strong>Encrypted</strong> using Android's built-in security features</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Note:</strong> API keys are sensitive credentials. We recommend using dedicated API keys with limited permissions and monitoring your usage through the respective service providers. You are responsible for securing your API keys and managing your account usage with these third-party services.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We prioritize your data security through local processing and secure third-party infrastructure. Your images and translations never leave your device. Payment processing uses Google's secure infrastructure. While we implement best practices for secure local processing and data transmission, please note that no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on your device or transmitted to third-party services.</p>

<h2>Screen Capture and File Access Permissions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Screen Capture:</strong> Our app uses the Android Media Projection API to capture screenshots for translation. When you initiate a capture, the system will display a standard prompt to confirm your permission. Captured content is processed temporarily for translation and is never stored or transmitted unless you explicitly save or share it.</li>
    <li><strong>Overlay Permission (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW):</strong> Required to display the floating translation button and result panels over other applications.</li>
    <li><strong>File Access:</strong> We use the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to save translated images and exported PDFs. This allows our app to access only the specific files or directories that you explicitly select, rather than requiring broad access to all files on your device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Cosmo Screen &amp; Comic Translate is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child is using our app, you can disable personalized ads through Android device settings, clear app data to remove any locally stored preferences, or consider using premium features to eliminate advertising entirely.</p>

<h2>Data Management</h2>

<h3>Local Data</h3>
<p>Data stored locally on your device (preferences, glossaries, cached models) is retained until you clear the app's data through Android settings, uninstall the application, or manually delete specific data like glossary entries.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Data</h3>
<p>Advertising data is retained according to Google's policies, crash reports are typically retained for 90 days, and purchase data is retained according to Google Play's billing policies and legal requirements.</p>

<h3>Data Deletion</h3>
<p>To delete your data, clear app data in Android settings or uninstall the app (local), reset your advertising ID in Android settings (ads), or contact us to request deletion of specific crash reports.</p>

<h2>User Responsibility for Translated Content</h2>
<p>Users are solely responsible for ensuring they have proper rights and permissions before distributing or sharing translated images, particularly for copyrighted material such as comics, manga, or other protected content. This app is a translation tool only - users must comply with all applicable copyright laws and intellectual property rights. We are not responsible for any copyright infringement or legal issues arising from user-generated translations or distribution of translated content.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
